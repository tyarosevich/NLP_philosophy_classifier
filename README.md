# Classifying Philosophy Papers As 'Good,' 'Bad,' 'Continental,' and 'Analytic'

This project is an experiment to see if simple, statistical classifier methods could be used to classify a relatively small corpus of philosophy papers. 

# Motivation

This project was originally begun to satisfy the final project in AMATH 582 at the University of Washington, in the Applied Mathematics department. This is a graduate course on scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning that focuses on signal processing and multivariate analysis.

# Contributing

This is a simple experiment in NLP. Pull requests are welcome, though the nature of the project is highly specific. The corpus is not open license, and while I am licensed to access it, I cannot share it.
